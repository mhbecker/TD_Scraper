# Purpose
This repository documents the webscraper and automation scripts to capture twice-daily front-page and post-level data on TheDonald.win.

# Disclaimer
Please note that these scripts are made publicly available for archiving and data transparency purposes. Since the initial data collection in the associated project, the domain name for TheDonald.win has changed and the webscraper script has not been updated to execute on the new site. Accordingly, the script will not run as-is and will need revision if you plan to update the procedure. Please feel free to get in touch if you have questions about updating this script.
